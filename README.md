Windows Defender Disabler Tool

This tool allows users to temporarily disable Windows Defender's scanning and protection features. It simulates a loading process while making necessary modifications to the system registry, effectively disabling real-time protection and other Defender services. It is useful for those who need to temporarily free up system resources from Defender's scanning processes, such as when performing intensive tasks or using other software that may conflict with Defender's real-time protection.
