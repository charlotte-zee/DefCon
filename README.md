# Windows Defender Disabler Tool

This tool allows users to temporarily disable Windows Defender's scanning and protection features. It makes necessary modifications to the system registry, effectively disabling real-time protection and other Defender services. It is useful for those who need to temporarily free up system resources from Defender's scanning processes, such as when performing intensive tasks or using other software that may conflict with Defender's real-time protection.

#Important: Steps Before Proceeding
**Please turn off everything in Windows Defender settings manually before using this tool** to avoid any conflicts during the process. This tool modifies Windows Defender settings through registry changes, and it is recommended to ensure that Defender is completely disabled beforehand.

## Usage

After following the above steps, run the program to disable Windows Defender policies.
